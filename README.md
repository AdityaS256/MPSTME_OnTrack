# MPSTME OnTrack
Developed using Flutter, MPSTME OnTrack is built with an aim of never letting anyone from MPSTME get late to a lecture searching for their class. MPSTME OnTrack allows a user to store their schedule with their class details. It has inbuilt features such as floor plans and class highlighting to easily navigate through the campus with pre-lecture notifications to make sure you reach before time.
